## Career Basics

---

### **Description:**
Senior Software Engineers are information technology professionals who develop information systems by studying operations; designing, developing and installing software solutions–knowledgeable in delivering software’s end-to-end life cycle. They lead a team of developers responsible for building new and supporting existing websites. 

### **Duties & Responsibilities:**
- Executing full lifecycle software development
- Develop software solutions: studying information needs and systems flow, conferring with users, data usage and work processes, investigating problem areas
- Programming well-designed, testable, efficient code
- Producing software specifications and defining system functionality
- Determine operational feasibility by evaluating analysis, problem definition, requirements, solution development and proposed solutions

<br/>

---

### **Required Education:**
- A bachelor's degree: computer science, computer engineering, software engineering or mathematics
- A master's or doctoral degree in a related discipline may be required.
- Licensing by a provincial or territorial association of professional engineers is required to approve engineering drawings and reports and to practise as a Professional Engineer (P.Eng.).
- Engineers are eligible for registration following graduation from an accredited educational program, three or four years of supervised work experience in engineering, and passing a professional practice examination.
